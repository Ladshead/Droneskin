									<p>For this project, the team set out to create a miniature for the Table-Top Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). The goal of the project was to have a miniature that could be used to represent an Ancient Red Dragon at a game table. The design was based off of the Ancient Red Dragon illustration from the D&D Monster Manual. Some other ideas we had during this stage were for a Purple Worm, which is also a monster from the D&D Monster Manual, and a Rock with a face of anguish. The dragon was selected as the final design as it had more universal appeal. </p>
									<p>When designing this piece, considerations had to be made about the environment in which it would be used. TTRPGs, as the name suggests, are played at a table. This means that games usually take place internally, under artificial lights, and within low-impact environments. These conditions influenced the choices that were made regarding materials; Since the product wasn't going to be exposed to sunlight, there wasn’t a requirement to use UV-resistant materials, such as acrylic or polyetherimide. The product also didn’t need to be made of an impact-resistant material, such as nylon, as in its intended setting it would not be used roughly.</p>
									<p>Due to the use case of the artefact, one of the most important considerations was that it was cheap to print and could be painted. The cost requirement was because the model was relatively large. The need for a paintable material was because painting miniatures is part of the TTRPG hobby, which was this model's intended use case. </p>

									<h2>3D scanning hardware, software, and workshop facilities</h2>
									<p>3D scanning was chosen as the first technique for this project, this was because the team had access to a Young Green Dragon miniature. From this miniature, the design of the Ancient Red Dragon could be built. For 3D scanning a HandyScan 3D with VX elements was used, this allowed for an accurate and detailed digital representation, which was obtained by circling the model while scanning. One issue that arose in this stage was that the position of the model had it leaning on one wing, this obscured a large section of its body and meant that the wing deformed slightly while the weight of the dragon was resting on it. Due to this, and the detail of the model, it took forty minutes and multiple scans, which were then edited together, to get a full 3D scan. The deformation of the wing also caused issues with the combining of the scans, as the wing returned to its usual place when the dragon was placed in a different position. This issue meant that combining the model took more time and care. Once completed, the team had access to a detailed STL of the Young Green Dragon model, which was then used for 3D modelling.</p>

									<h2>3D modelling software </h2>
									<h4>Left &amp; Right</h4>
													<p>The dragon was shaped using Blender, a tool known for its sculpting features. Rough edges were smoothed, and imperfections were fixed to create a clean look. Then the model was adapted to better resemble the design of an ancient red dragon. Due to the complexity of the model and of the intended changes the model was split into three segments, so a different member of the team could work on each one.</p>
													<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/headblend.png" alt="" /></span>To begin, the vertices around the neck were selected and a new face was created, this patched the hole that was created when the head was removed from the body. Next, the head was slightly enlarged with the draw and grab tools. This created a broader head, which was more in line with an Ancient Red Dragon design. The draw tool was then used to create definition on the lower jaw, this included elongating the chin spikes and then using the draw sharp tool to add valleys between them. The snake hook tool was used to elongate the horns and frills, but this stretched the polygons to an unreasonable length. Therefore, a mix of the draw and elastic deform tools was used instead. Then the smooth tool was used to ensure none of the shapes were reliant on a few overstretched polygons. The split tool was used to separate the top and bottom jaw, and an extra segment was removed from the top jaw to create an obtuse angle for the bottom jaw to fit in. This meant that the bottom jaw was capable of opening and closing on a hinge. To finish off, the vertices were connected around the holes left in both the top and bottom jaw. </p>
													<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/bodyblend.png" alt="" /></span>Next, the body was smoothed to remove rugged textures and sudden edges; this reduced the complexity of the model, which made it easier to render and print. Smoothing the dragon did reduce the quality of some features, for example, the texture of the scales was lost, but this was a worthwhile trade-off as it gave a blanker slate from which the Ancient Red Dragon design could be built. The model that was scanned had been built to rest on a stand, this meant there was a hole in the model's torso where the stand would slot in. To better incorporate the proposed design, this hole needed to be filled. Some attempts were made to remove the hole using the fill and smooth sculpting tools, but these were unsuccessful. In the end, it was easier to select the vertices around the hole and create a face. From here the face could be smoothed, in order to remove any sign of the hole. From here, the spikes on the wings and the frills on the spine were elongated, using the draw and pull tool. For the spikes specifically, the snake hook tool was used to give the spikes a twisting appearance. Then the vertices around the tail and neck were selected, to create two new faces. This patched the holes on either side of the body.</p>
													<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tailblend.png" alt="" /></span>For the tail, the first step was filling in the hole by selecting the vertices around the hole and creating a new face. Next, the frills were elongated using the elongate tool. The tail was then split in two, this was to accommodate the idea of segments connected with Chicago screws. Time constraints and an unfamiliarity with the software meant that this was unachievable. The tail was kept as two sections, with the hope that the team could find a mechanism to connect these pieces and allow movement. The vertices on these holes were then connected to create two new faces. </p>
													<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>Once the design was to a satisfactory standard, it was moved into Fusion 360. In Fusion 360, tweaks were made to ensure the scale of the model was consistent before being sent to print. However, some issues with scale were revealed during the print..</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>3D printing hardware and workshop facilities</h2>
									<p>After finalising the design, the model was prepared for printing by exporting it as an STL file, ensuring compatibility with 3D printing software. The file was then transmitted to the 3D printing facility where PLA filament was selected to bring the envisioned design to life.</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>Due to the scale of the model it had to be printed in sections. The first section to be printed was the head, which was made up of a top and a bottom jaw which were printed separately. There was a slight misprint on the horns, which resulted in a rough texture. This was likely due to over-stretching the model during 3D modelling.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/goodname.jpg" alt="" /></span>After this, the body was printed. The body was the largest section of the model, as it contained the torso, legs, and wings. When printing this section, there were some misprints on the wings. These misprints took the form of wire-like bundles of PLA, where some of the wing spikes should have been. These errors were not overly concerning for this model, as the bundles could be removed and it could be painted to look like battle damage, but in future printings, care would be taken to ensure these spikes are properly rendered.</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tail.jpg" alt="" /></span>Finally, the tail was printed in two parts; A short section that connected to the body, and a longer segment that would be attached with a mechanism in order to swivel left to right. This section was printed without error.</p>

									<p>One issue that was present once each section had been printed was that the body was scaled differently from the head and tail. This meant that there was a lip where the head and tail connected to the body. When printing this piece again, care will have to be taken to ensure the scale matches.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Painting</h2>
									<p>To paint on the PLA, the model needed to be primed. A Citadel Colour White Scar Primer was used to ensure that the acrylic would stick to the PLA. The primer would also ensure that the paint was visible, as the primer was white, and the PLA was black. Citadel paints were used for painting the model, this is because they were widely available and relatively cheap. Our team also had experience with these paints, making them the best choice for this project. To begin, a base layer of Abaddon Black Base was applied all over, this would create shading in the recesses. Next, the horns and bones were painted with Zandri Dust Base. The frills were painted with Khorne Red Base, and this was mixed with Abaddon Black to create a gradient effect. For the majority of the skin, Mephiston Red Base was used, for a lighter shade of red. For the teeth Corax White Base was used, this was also used for the highlights by dry brushing. Finally, an Agrax Earthshade Shade was applied to give the model a gloss and to darken the recesses to create shadows.</p>

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									<p>In summary, this portfolio documents the journey of creating a miniature dragon for Table-Top Role-Playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. It explores different techniques used, like 3D scanning, 3D modelling, 3D printing, and painting. The focus was on making the dragon look authentic and fit for gaming tables.</p>
									<p>The heart of the portfolio lies in the design phase, where tools like Blender and Fusion 360 were used to sculpt the form of the dragon and to adjust its size. Challenges arose during printing, but solutions were found to ensure the quality of the model was not too heavily impacted.</p>
									<p>Painting brought the dragon to life, through attention to detail, a satisfying aesthetic end point was reached. While some techniques like resin casting and haptic hardware were considered, they weren't used in the end.</p>
									<p>In future, the hinge would need to be installed in the jaw, this would allow the mouth to open and close as the user pleased. The tail would also be split into segments and connected by Chicago screws, allowing the tail a range of motion. These changes would make for a more interactive model. These were intended features of the prototype, but due to time constraints they could not be implemented. </p>
