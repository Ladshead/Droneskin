									<p>For this project we set out to create a miniature for the Table Top Role Playing Game (TTRPG) Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). The goal of the project was to have a miniature that could be used to represent an Ancient Red Dragon at a game table. We based our design off of the Ancient Red Dragon illustration from the D&D Monster Manual.</p>
									<p>When designing this piece we had to consider the environment in which it would be used. TTRPG's, as the name suggests, are played at a table. This means that games usually take place internally, under artificial lights, and within low impact environments. These conditions influenced the choices we made regarding materials; Since the product wasn't going to be exposed to sunlight, we weren't limited to UV resistant materials, such as acrylic or polyetherimide. We also didn't need an impact resistant resistant material, such as nylon, as in its intended setting it would not be used roughly.</p>
									<p>Due to the use case of our product, one of the most important considerations was that the product wouldn't deform or .</p>

									<h2>3D scanning hardware, software, and workshop facilities</h2>
									<p>For 3D scanning we used a HandyScan 3D with VX elements, this allowed us to get an accurate and detailed digital representation by circling the model while scanning. One issue that arose in this stage was that the position of the model had it leaning on one wing, this obscured a large section of its body and meant that the wing deformed slightly while the weight of the dragon was resting on it. Due to this, and the detail of the model, it took forty minutes and multiple scans, which were then edited together, to get a full 3D scan. The deformation of the wing also caused issues with the combining of the scans, as the wing returned to its usual place when the dragon was placed in a different position. This issue meant that combining the model took more time and care.</p>

									<h2>3D modelling software </h2>
									<h4>Left &amp; Right</h4>
													<p>The dragon was shaped using Blender, a tool known for its sculpting features. Rough edges were smoothed, and imperfections were fixed to create a clean look. Then the model was adapted to better resemble the design of an ancient red dragon. Due to the complexity of the model and of the intended changes the model was split into three segments, so a different member of the team could work on each one.</p>
													<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/headblend.png" alt="" /></span>To begin, the vertices around the neck were selected and a new face was created, this patched the hole that was created when the head was removed from the body. Next, the head was slightly enlarged with the draw and grab tools. This created a broader head, which was more in line with an Ancient Red Dragon design. The draw tool was then used to create definition on the lower jaw, this included elongating the chin spikes and then using the draw sharp tool to add valleys between them. The snake hook tool was used to elongate the horns and frills, but this stretched the polygons to an unreasonable length. Therefore, a mix of the draw and elastic deform tools was used instead. Then the smooth tool was used to ensure none of the shapes were reliant on a few overstretched polygons. The split tool was used to separate the top and bottom jaw, and an extra segment was removed from the top jaw to create an obtuse angle for the bottom jaw to fit in. This meant that the bottom jaw was capable of opening and closing on a hinge. To finish off, the vertices were connected around the holes left in both the top and bottom jaw. </p>
													<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/bodyblend.png" alt="" /></span>Next, the body was smoothed to remove rugged textures and sudden edges; this reduced the complexity of the model, which made it easier to render and print. Smoothing the dragon did reduce the quality of some features, for example, the texture of the scales was lost, but this was a worthwhile trade-off as it gave a blanker slate from which the Ancient Red Dragon design could be built. The model that was scanned had been built to rest on a stand, this meant there was a hole in the model's torso where the stand would slot in. To better incorporate the proposed design, this hole needed to be filled. Some attempts were made to remove the hole using the fill and smooth sculpting tools, but these were unsuccessful. In the end, it was easier to select the vertices around the hole and create a face. From here the face could be smoothed, in order to remove any sign of the hole. From here, the spikes on the wings and the frills on the spine were elongated, using the draw and pull tool. For the spikes specifically, the snake hook tool was used to give the spikes a twisting appearance. Then the vertices around the tail and neck were selected, to create two new faces. This patched the holes on either side of the body.</p>
													<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tailblend.png" alt="" /></span>For the tail the first step was filling in the hole by selecting the vertices around the hole and creating a new face. Next the frills were elongated using the elongate tool. The tail was then split in two, to allow for a mechanism to be built between them. The vertices on these holes were then connected to create two new faces.</p>
													<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>Once the quality of the design was to a suitable standard, it was moved into Fusion 360 to ensure it was the right size. The dimensions were then tweaked to meet the intended scale before moving forward.</p>

									<h2>3D printing hardware and workshop facilities</h2>
									<p>After finalising the design, the model was prepared for printing by exporting it as an STL file, ensuring compatibility with 3D printing software. The file was then transmitted to the 3D printing facility where PLA filament was selected to bring the envisioned design to life.</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>Due to the scale of the model it had to be printed in sections. The first section to be printed was the head, this was made up of a top and a bottom jaw that were printed separately.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/goodname.jpg" alt="" /></span>After this, the body was printed. The body was the largest section of the body, as it contained the torso, legs, and wings. When printing this section, there were some misprints on the wings. These misprints took the form of wire-like bundles of PLA, where some of the wing spikes should have been. These errors were not overly concerning for this model, as the bundles could be removed and it could be painted to look like battle damage, but in future printings, care would be taken to ensure these spikes are properly rendered.</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tail.jpg" alt="" /></span>Finally, the tail was printed in two parts; A short section that connected to the body, and a longer segment that would be attached with a mechanism in order to swivel left to right. This section was printed without error.</p>

									<p>One issue that was present once each section had been printed was that the body was scaled differently from the head and tail. This meant that there was a lip where the head and tail connected to the body. When printing this piece again, care will have to be taken to ensure the scale matches.</p>
